## If this was a real SaaS tool, what 2 features would you prioritize next and why?

The two features that first come to my mind are:
- Authentication : This could help save a person's preferences across platforms and devices
- AI suggestions : As this is supposed to be an AI dashboard, a basic implementation of Generative AI to suggest names and images for avatars would be nice.

## What was one challenge you faced in this task, and how did you solve or approach it?

The task I found the most challenging was making the modal disappear on outside interactions. Initially the modal kept on disappearing even when I clicked on the modal, to overcome this I took help of BlackBox AI. Actually, I had to separately prevent the click event from occurring on the modal, which initially seemed pretty counter intuitive, but worked out well eventually.
